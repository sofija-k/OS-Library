# OS-Library
* Developed an operating system library in C. Utilized OS theory to enforce multiprocessing by creating a user-level threads API that supports context switching, cooperative & preemptive threading and system calls in `A1-Cooperative-Threads` and `A2-Preemtive-Threads` files.
* Implemented blocking locks to support mutual exclusion and constructed condition variables to support synchronization in `A2-Preemtive-Threads` file.
* Investigated memory access patterns to specifically design page tables and implement page replacement algorithms (RR, 2Q, Clock) to enforce virtual-to-physical address translation and demand paging in `A3-Virtual-Memory` file.
* Implemented file system using FUSE to interact with user space, constructed command line tools and system calls in `A4-File-System`.

#### Each Assignment file A1,A2,A3 and A4 constain a seperate README.md file that illustrates the details, effectiveness and core functionality of the above implementations
